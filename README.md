# Invasive species R exercise

Welcome!

Tomorrow you have to report the updated invasive species records to the European commission. In order to do to, you have to provide the following outputs:

1. Create a bar chart with the total number of individuals counted for each species. 

2. Create a map based on the `EUgrid10.geojson` GIS vector file for which the color scale of each cell represents the overal counts of invasive species in the respective grid cell.

3. Put both outputs together in a single report and briefly discuss the results of this analysis.

Try to do as much as possible within the given time limit. Use the tools and knowledge you already have to solve the assignments. If some elements do not work, try to describe how you want to tackle it.

If you write code, put your R or Rmd scripts in the `src` folder. 

We wish you all the best!
